      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! I'm Hmeet and this site is a glimpse into my world beyond a resume or LinkedIn profile.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a senior Computer Science and Physics student at UBC with a passion for creating innovative solutions and exploring the intersection of technology and creativity. 
        My interests include leveraging technology to solve real-world problems, especially issues pertaining to social justice and community service.
        In my free time, I enjoy reading, painting, and volunteering in my community.
